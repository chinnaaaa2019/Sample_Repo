GitPython Tutorial
GitPython provides object model access to your git repository. This tutorial is composed of multiple sections, most of which explains a real-life usecase.

All code presented here originated from test_docs.py to assure correctness. Knowing this should also allow you to more easily run the code for your own testing purposes, all you need is a developer installation of git-python.

Meet the Repo type
The first step is to create a git.Repo object to represent your repository.

In the above example, the directory self.rorepo.working_tree_dir equals /Users/mtrier/Development/git-python and is my working repository which contains the .git directory. You can also initialize GitPython with a bare repository.
